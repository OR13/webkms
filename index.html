      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
Cryptographic authentication systems enable machines, individuals, and
organizations to more securely interact with one another. These systems often
use public-private key cryptography or encryption mechanisms in order to  manage
cryptographic material as well as operations utilizing that material. There are
a variety of these sorts of cryptographic systems in use today, sometimes
referred to as Key Management Systems. While many of these sorts of systems
exist, there is no common interface for accessing and using these systems.
      </p>
      <p>
If there were a common API, then you could create drivers for each specific KMS that map to the common API and write applications just once
      </p>
      <p>
Drivers could potentially even wrap keystores like FIDO, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
If the API was a Web API then you can write Web Apps against this API and servers can offer one or more KMSes -- and potentially even allow users to bring their own
      </p>
      <p>
There is a relatively small set of common crypto operations that KMSes provide:
      </p>
      <p>
A list is here: https://github.com/digitalbazaar/web-kms-switch/tree/http-sig/lib/schemas
      </p>
      <p>
These crypto operations are all really just "methods" that operate on "objects" (keys) in a remote execution environment
      </p>
      <p>
There's another spec, called Authorization Capabilities, that is all about remote execution environments with objects and methods -- and granting the authority to remote clients to call those methods on those objects via "capabilities" or "zcaps"
      </p>
      <p>
A KMS can provide a Web KMS API that allows users to create keys and execute crypto operations on them by invoking zcaps
      </p>
      <p>
The Web KMS API allows users to create keystores (a type of "object") that they control (the user is the "controller" of the keystore)
      </p>
      <p>
The keystore has a method for generating a key (another type of "object") of a certain "type" and associating it with that keystore
      </p>
      <p>
Each keystore and key is identified by a URI
      </p>
      <p>
Each key has a set of "methods", according to its "type", that can be remotely executed via zcaps, such that the key material need never be exfiltrated in order to use the key
      </p>
      <p>
In order to execute a method on a key, a KmsOperation of a specific type can be posted to the key URL (using HTTPS), including a zcap invocation via http signatures
      </p>
      <p>
A keystore's controller can be changed to enable transfer of keys or to add other parties to help manage the keys
      </p>

        <h3>Ecosystem Overview</h3>

        <p>
This section describes the roles of the core actors and the relationships
between them in an ecosystem where this specification is expected
to be useful. A role is an abstraction that might be implemented in many
different ways. The separation of roles suggests likely interfaces and
protocols for standardization. The following roles are introduced in this
specification:
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt>cryptographic agent</dt>
          <dd>
A role an <a>entity</a> might perform by
          </dd>
          <dt>key management system</dt>
          <dd>
A role an <a>entity</a> might perform by
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <h3>Use Cases and Requirements</h3>

        <p>
The USE-CASES document outlines a number
of key topics that readers might find useful, including:

As a result of documenting and analyzing the use cases document, the following
desirable ecosystem characteristics were identified for this specification:

    <h2>Security Considerations</h2>

    <p>
There are a number of security considerations that implementers should be
aware of when processing data described by this specification. Ignoring or
not understanding the implications of this section can result in
security vulnerabilities.
    </p>

    <p>
While this section attempts to highlight a broad set of security
considerations, it is not a complete list. Implementers are urged to seek the
advice of security and cryptography professionals when implementing mission
critical systems using the technology outlined in this specification.

    <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>

    <p>
There are a number of accessibility considerations implementers should be
aware of when processing data described in this specification. As with any web
standards or protocols implementation, ignoring accessibility issues makes
this information unusable to a large subset of the population. It is important
to follow accessibility guidelines and standards, such as [[WCAG21]], to ensure
all people, regardless of ability, can make use of this data. This is
especially important when establishing systems utilizing cryptography, which
have historically created problems for assistive technologies.

This section details the general accessibility considerations to take into
account when utilizing this data model.

    <h2>Internationalization Considerations</h2>

    <p>
There are a number of internationalization considerations implementers should be
aware of when publishing data described in this specification. As with any web
standards or protocols implementation, ignoring internationalization makes it
difficult for data to be produced and consumed across a disparate set of
languages and societies, which would limit the applicability of the
specification and significantly diminish its value as a standard.

    <p>
This section outlines general internationalization considerations to take into
account when utilizing this data model.
