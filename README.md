## WebKMS Specification

This specification describes a mechanism for performing remote cryptographic
key operations including key creation, signing, encryption, and decryption.
This technology is useful when securing communications using web-based,
hardware backed cryptographic systems.

We encourage contributions meeting the [Contribution
